<div class="blurb">
  <p>We have many music groups on offer at JPC. These include rock bands, concert bands, vocal groups, unplugged groups and a liturgy band. They are a great way to improve your music skills whilst also having fun.</p>
  <p>There are many opportunities for people in the groups to attend excursions and perform at prestigious venues throughout the year. For example, stage 88 during Floriade. These groups are open to all year and skill levels and are run outside of scheduled class time at JPC.</p>
  <p>It only costs $25 a term to be apart of our amazing extra curricular activities! If you are interested in joining a rock band, concert band, vocal group or unplugged group, follow the link below and fill out an expression of interest form.</p>
