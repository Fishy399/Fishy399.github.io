    <p>JPC runs many different drama groups throughout the year. Currently the main extra curricular drama group is Spotlight which is held in the theatre after school on Thursdays. Here students can work on sharpening their acting skills and practise for upcoming drama assesmements. Spotlight doesn't require previous experiance and stundents are encouraged to come along to the practise times and see if it is something that they'd be interested in joining.</p>
